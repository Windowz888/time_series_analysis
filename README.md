Time Series Analysis of Earth's Geomagnetic Intensity
This repository contains the materials for a project studying the Earth's geomagnetic secular variation. The Earth's magnetic field behaves like a giant bar magnet with a magnetic north and south pole. These poles have been drifting from Canada towards Siberia at an increasing rate, possibly influenced by a strong positive geomagnetic anomaly near Lake Baikal in Siberia. Understanding these changes is crucial due to their impacts on global navigation systems, satellite performance, and protection against solar flares, magnetic storms, and cosmic rays.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a forecasting methodology based on the Box-Jenkins framework to predict the magnetic intensities of the North and South poles at their current locations. The project aims to provide hands-on experience dealing with the challenges faced by a time series analyst in real-world situations.

Project Structure
This repository includes an analysis script (TS Earth Geomagnetic pole.Rmd), the data used for the analysis (Geomagnetic_Intensity_Data.xlsx), and a report that summarizes the findings (TS_porj.pdf).

Objectives and Learning Outcomes
This project's objective is to provide hands-on experience dealing with the challenges faced by a time series analyst in real-world situations. It is intended to hone independent thinking, decision-making, and validating the analysis outcomes without external sources for verification. The aim is to develop the abilities as an independent researcher, thinker, and problem solver in the field of time series analysis.
